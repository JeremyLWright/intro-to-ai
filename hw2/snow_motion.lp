% Most winters, you’ll find the majority of Townsville over Harrier Hill,
% enjoying the snowfall. From the early morning until just after dusk, people
% sled down the snowy slope, laughing and cheering all the while. Yesterday
% morning, seven young people (including Xerxes) were the first down the
% slope, riding five vehicles (a luge, a plastic sled, a toboggan, and two
% inner tubes). Some vehicles contained only one person, while others held
% two-riders. The seven enjoyed their brief time alone on Harrier Hill, but it
% wasn’t long before a blizzard of other sledders joined them! From the
% information provided, determine the other in which each vehicle sledded down
% the snowy slope and the rider or riders who sat in each vehicle.
%
% 1.	Each of the two inner tubes (one of which was the first down the slope) had only one rider.
% 2.	The toboggan (which has two riders) was the second vehicle down the slope.
% 3.	Vanessa rode the plastic sled down the slope at some point after, but not immediately after, the luge went down
% 4.	Kira and Ollie (who rode on the same vehicle) slipped down the slope immediately before Regan.
% 5.	Blake and Flynn rode the same vehicle and it was not an inner tube.
